# telegram-bot
A **very simple** example of Telegram Bot for curiosity purposes.

It's called *@valenza_bot* and if you say "Matheus" he will answer "Valenza". 

Sorry for my lack of creativity.

The server was made with NodeJS and deployed with Heroku.

You can test it: [telegram.me/valenza_bot](https://telegram.me/valenza_bot)
